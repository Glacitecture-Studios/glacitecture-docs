  <p>Welcome to the first devlog for Syncra, our ambitious project to create a Rhythm Game Level Development Toolkit that can be applied to a vast majority of engines and existing games. In this post, we’ll outline the foundational work we’ve done so far and the frameworks we’re using to bring Syncra to life.</p>
<h2 id="tldr">TL;DR</h2>
<p>We&rsquo;ve been laying the foundation of Syncra’s architecture — including a robust data model, essential libraries, and initial project structure — while beginning implementation of the first core features.</p>
<p>For the Syncra Editor, we’ve chosen Godot as our primary platform. Its flexibility, scripting power, and strong OS integration make it ideal for building a toolkit that supports cross-engine workflows and features like Git and file management.</p>
<p>On the engine side, we&rsquo;re evaluating options to make Syncra easily integrable into existing projects. At its core will be a Common Library written in C or Rust — designed to be lightweight, efficient, and portable. Built on top of that will be modular Runtime Libraries offering high-level abstractions tailored to Syncra’s functionality.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re currently targeting support for Godot, Unity, and Unreal Engine. By supporting multiple platforms, we hope to reach a wider audience and provide a flexible, powerful toolset for developers of all kinds.</p>
<p>When it comes to exporting for existing games, we&rsquo;re currently evaluating which titles should be our first integration targets. We want to ensure that Syncra can integrate seamlessly with popular engines and games, such as osu!, Friday Night Funkin&rsquo;, and others that have a strong modding community. (This requires a bit of research, specifically for osu! as it has a unique file structure which is not well documented.)</p>
<p>As for actual progress on the Editor, we&rsquo;ve made significant strides in the past few weeks. We have a partially working prototype that allows users to place notes on a timeline and adjust their properties. The UI is still rough around the edges, but it’s functional enough to start testing the core concepts. Saving and Loading projects is currently non-functional; we have the UI in place, but the backend logic is still being developed.</p>
<h2 id="planning-foundations">Planning Foundations</h2>
<p>Before diving into implementation, we spent a lot of time planning the architecture and design of Syncra. This involved defining the core data structures, workflows, and user interactions that would form the backbone of the toolkit.</p>
<p>We started by identifying the key components of Syncra:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Model</strong>: The structure that defines how levels, notes, and other entities are represented.</li>
<li><strong>Editor</strong>: The user interface for creating and editing levels, including timelines, note placement, and property adjustments.</li>
<li><strong>Runtime Libraries</strong>: The libraries that will handle the playback and interaction logic for levels created with Syncra.</li>
<li><strong>Export Mechanism</strong>: The system that will convert Syncra projects into formats compatible with various game engines and existing games.</li>
</ul>
<p>We also established a set of principles to guide our development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Modularity</strong>: Syncra should be built in a way that allows for easy extension and integration with other tools and engines.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: The toolkit should work seamlessly across different operating systems and game engines.</li>
<li><strong>User-Centric Design</strong>: The editor should be intuitive and easy to use, allowing developers to focus on creativity rather than technical hurdles.</li>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Syncra should be efficient in terms of memory and processing, ensuring smooth operation even with complex levels.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-model">Data Model</h3>
<p>Syncra&rsquo;s Data Model is designed to be flexible and easily modifiable. It is primarily a ZIP-Based Format built on top of a JSON structure, allowing for easy serialization and deserialization. This format will enable us to store levels, notes, and other entities in a way that is both human-readable and machine-friendly.</p>
<p>The core components of the Data Model include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Level</strong>: Represents a complete rhythm game level, including metadata, timing information, and a collection of notes.</li>
<li><strong>Note</strong>: Represents an individual note in the level, including its position, timing, type, and any additional properties.</li>
<li><strong>Timing</strong>: Represents the timing information for the level, including BPM (Beats Per Minute), offsets, and any tempo changes.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: Contains information about the level, such as title, artist, difficulty, and any custom properties defined by the user.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="editor-framework">Editor Framework</h3>
<p>The Syncra Editor is being built using Godot, leveraging its powerful scene system and scripting capabilities. The editor will provide a timeline-based interface for creating and editing levels, allowing users to place notes, adjust their properties, and visualize the timing of the level.</p>
<p>The core features of the Syncra Editor include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeline View</strong>: A visual representation of the level&rsquo;s timing, allowing users to see the placement of notes in relation to the music.</li>
<li><strong>Note Placement</strong>: A system for placing notes on the timeline, with support for different note types and properties.</li>
<li><strong>Property Editor</strong>: A panel for adjusting the properties of selected notes, including position, timing, and custom attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Project Management</strong>: A system for creating, saving, and loading Syncra projects, allowing users to manage their levels and assets easily.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="core-libraries">Core Libraries</h3>
<p>To support the Syncra Editor and Runtime Libraries, we are developing a core library that will provide essential functionality and abstractions. This library will be written in C or Rust, ensuring that it is lightweight, efficient, and portable across different platforms.</p>
<p>The core components of the library include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Data Serialization</strong>: Functions for serializing and deserializing the Syncra Data Model</li>
<li><strong>Timing Calculations</strong>: Utilities for calculating timing information, including BPM conversions, offsets, and tempo changes.</li>
<li><strong>Note Management</strong>: Functions for creating, modifying, and deleting notes, as well as handling their properties and interactions.</li>
<li><strong>File Management</strong>: Functions for reading and writing Syncra project files, including support for ZIP-based formats.</li>
<li><strong>Cross-Platform Compatibility</strong>: Ensuring that the library can be used across different operating systems and game engines, with minimal dependencies.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="runtime-libraries">Runtime Libraries</h3>
<p>The Runtime Libraries will provide higher-level abstractions for integrating Syncra levels into game engines and existing games. These libraries will be built on top of the core library and will include engine-specific implementations for handling playback, input, and visual effects.</p>
<p>The core components of the Runtime Libraries include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Playback Engine</strong>: The core engine that handles the timing and playback of notes, ensuring that they are triggered at the correct times and with the appropriate effects.</li>
<li><strong>Input Handling</strong>: A system for capturing user input, allowing players to interact with the level and trigger notes in real-time. (engine specific)</li>
<li><strong>Visual Effects</strong>: A set of visual effects that can be applied to notes and the level, enhancing the overall experience and providing feedback to the player. (engine specific)</li>
<li><strong>Audio Integration</strong>: A system for integrating audio playback with the level, ensuring that notes are synchronized with the music. (engine specific, considering FMOD compatibility)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="exportimport-mechanism">Export/Import Mechanism</h3>
<p>The export mechanism will allow users to convert Syncra projects into formats compatible with various game engines and existing games. This will involve creating a set of export plugins for each target engine, ensuring that the exported levels retain their timing, note properties, and other essential information.</p>
<p>The import mechanism will allow users to bring existing levels from other formats into Syncra, enabling them to take advantage of the toolkit&rsquo;s features and workflows. This will involve creating import plugins for popular formats used in rhythm games, such as osu! beatmaps and FNF levels.</p>
